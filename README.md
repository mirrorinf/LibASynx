#LibAsynx: The Flexible Concurrent Programming Library for C
As is known to all, the C programming language have a great concurrent library: libdispatch. However, this library only runs well on OS X and BSD systems. So, LibAsynx comes. It aims at making a flexible, easy, cross-platform and extendable library for concurrent programming.

##Note: LibAsynx is currently neither powerful, nor reliable. It's now EXPERIMENTAL.

##Help me!
I'm a high school student who have very little time to code. Nor do I have enough knowledge to write excellent projects by myself. Any comment on how to make the library better would help a lot. My email addr is mirrorinf@icloud.com, please send your ideas if you would like to help me!(I will be more than grateful if anyone can help me with the code!)
